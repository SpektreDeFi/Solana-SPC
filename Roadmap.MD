# Project Roadmap for the Solana SPC Framework

## Phase 1: Initial Development
- **Q2 2024**: Design and develop initial smart contracts for transaction bundling.
- **Q3 2024**: Implement the first version of dynamic congestion management algorithms.

## Phase 2: Testing and Feedback
- **Q4 2024**: Deploy initial SPCs on Solana's testnet.
- **Q1 2025**: Gather feedback from developers and adjust based on testnet results.

## Phase 3: Enhancement and Optimization
- **Q2 2025**: Enhance transaction bundling algorithms based on Phase 2 feedback.
- **Q3 2025**: Optimize congestion management algorithms for better performance and efficiency.

## Phase 4: Mainnet Deployment
- **Q4 2025**: Begin phased deployment of SPCs to Solana's mainnet, starting with less critical transactions.
- **Q1 2026**: Full deployment of SPCs, including all transaction types.

## Phase 5: Ongoing Development and Scaling
- **2026 and beyond**: Continue to scale and refine SPC functionalities. Focus on integrating new technologies and expanding the capability of the SPC framework to handle greater transaction volumes and more complex scenarios.

## Conclusion
Continue to highlight the long-term vision for the SPC framework, emphasizing its role in ensuring Solana remains scalable and efficient as blockchain technology evolves.
