# Solana-SPC
Repository for Side Processing Channels and transaction bundling smart contracts for Solana

# Solana Side Processing Channels (SPC) Framework

## Project Overview
This repository hosts the development of the Side Processing Channels (SPC) for the Solana blockchain, aimed at enhancing transaction processing during peak network congestion times. The project focuses on creating a robust system that integrates smart contract-based transaction bundling with dynamic congestion management strategies.

## Project Description
The SPC framework is designed to alleviate network strain by introducing auxiliary pathways for transactions when the main blockchain experiences high traffic. This approach helps maintain high throughput and reduce transaction latency across the network.

### Key Features
- **Transaction Bundling**: Aggregates multiple transactions into a single bundle to minimize processing delay and network load.
- **Dynamic Congestion Management**: Implements adaptive algorithms that assess network conditions in real-time and reroute or prioritize transactions to maintain efficient network operation.
- **SPC Activation**: Utilizes specific conditions under which Side Processing Channels are activated to handle transaction overflow, ensuring the main blockchain remains uncluttered during high transaction periods.

### Technical Objectives
- Develop smart contracts that facilitate transaction bundling within SPCs.
- Create algorithms that dynamically manage and adjust the operation of SPCs based on current network congestion data.
- Ensure seamless integration of SPCs without compromising the Solana blockchain's security or performance.

## Getting Involved
### Prerequisites
This project is built on Solana, so familiarity with Rust and the Solana environment is required. Participants should have:
- Rust programming skills.
- Understanding of blockchain technology, specifically Solana.

### Setup and Installation
Instructions for setting up the development environment will be provided as the project progresses. Initial setup will include cloning the repository and installing necessary Solana tools.

## Contributions
We encourage contributions from the community, whether it's code, documentation, or issue reports. Please see the `CONTRIBUTING.md` for how to get involved.

## Roadmap
- **Q1 2024**: Develop initial smart contracts for bundling transactions.
- **Q2 2024**: Implement and test dynamic congestion management algorithms.
- **Q3 2024**: Integrate SPCs with the main Solana network and begin testnet trials.
